# Week 7 Session 1!

## Reflection

In this session, we started working with sound in our code, which was something completely new to me. One of the most interesting things we learned was that even though sound frequencies increase exponentially, we hear them as if they‚Äôre increasing linearly. That made me think about how much of digital media relies on perception, not just raw data. We also learned that to get sound to play in a browser, there needs to be a user gesture like a mouse click before anything can start. At first, I didn‚Äôt understand why, but it actually made sense once I realized it's about giving the user control over when sound begins. It also made sound feel more interactive and intentional, rather than just something playing in the background. Overall, this session helped me see sound as something more than just an add-on it‚Äôs part of how the experience is shaped and how the system responds.

## HomeWork

For the sound in my AT2 project, I wanted it to feel a bit chaotic but not in a random or messy way. I started playing around with a basic oscillator in p5.js, and honestly, I found it way more interesting than I expected. Just changing the frequency slightly made the whole thing feel alive. I didn‚Äôt want the sound to be musical or melodic, but also not just noise. I was trying to find that in-between space something that reacts to the system and shifts over time, but still holds together. I think that‚Äôs what effective complexity is all about: it‚Äôs not total order or total disorder, but a weird balance of both. When it comes to sound, we usually rely on things like rhythm or repetition to make sense of what we‚Äôre hearing, so I played with that idea letting the sound grow or distort as the visual piece changes. I decided not to use voice because I didn‚Äôt want it to feel like it was telling you something directly. I liked the idea that the sound is just part of the system more like a mood than a message. Loveless talks about defamiliarisation ‚Äî making something feel strange or unfamiliar and I tried to do that here. The sound isn‚Äôt meant to comfort you or guide you. It‚Äôs meant to feel a little off, like you‚Äôre listening to something that‚Äôs alive, but you can‚Äôt quite place what it is.

### Interactive Sound Design: Sinusoidal Chaos Loop (24 Seconds)

For this experiment, I used my teacher‚Äôs provided canvas-based Web Audio API sketch as a starting point and played around with it to explore how interactive sound can move in and out of chaos. The goal was to create a system that cycles into disorder and back every 24 seconds, using a sinusoidal control to shape the user experience.

One of the most interesting parts of the experiment was noticing how chaos doesn‚Äôt have to be loud or random it can come from subtle changes in rhythm and timing. I explored this by manipulating how fast the notes play, how long they last, and how it all responds to mouse movement (user gesture).

<div style="padding: 2rem; background: #ffe4c4; text-align: center;">
  <p>üéµ Click the canvas to trigger sound. Move your mouse for playback variation.</p>
  <canvas id="vibraphone_canvas" width="400" height="200" style="background: #ff7f50; cursor: pointer;"></canvas>
</div>

<script>
const canvas = document.getElementById('vibraphone_canvas');
const audioCtx = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
let vibraphoneBuffer = null;
let startTime = Date.now();

// Load .wav file
fetch('vibraphone_note.mp3')
  .then(res => res.arrayBuffer())
  .then(data => audioCtx.decodeAudioData(data))
  .then(buffer => {
    vibraphoneBuffer = buffer;
    console.log("‚úÖ Audio loaded!");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error("‚ùå Error loading audio:", err);
  });

// On canvas click
canvas.onclick = (e) => {
  if (audioCtx.state === 'suspended') {
    audioCtx.resume();
    return;
  }

  if (!vibraphoneBuffer) {
    alert("Audio is still loading...");
    return;
  }

  const x = e.offsetX / canvas.width;

  // 24-second sinusoidal chaos modulation
  let t = (Date.now() - startTime) / 1000;
  let sineMod = Math.sin((2 * Math.PI * t) / 24);
  let chaosFactor = 0.5 + 1.5 * (0.5 + sineMod / 2);
  let rate = (2 ** x) * chaosFactor;

  playVibraphone(rate);
};

function playVibraphone(rate) {
  const source = audioCtx.createBufferSource();
  source.buffer = vibraphoneBuffer;
  source.playbackRate.value = rate;
  source.connect(audioCtx.destination);
  source.start();
}
</script>

# Week 7 Session 2!

## Reflection

This week was feedback week, and I finally got a chance to talk to Mux about my project. It was actually super helpful. He said he liked the way my piece starts to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù as it grows, and that surprised me I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was a good thing or just my code acting up. But he saw it as something interesting, like the system pushing its own limits. That made me think differently about how I‚Äôm approaching the visuals and sound maybe instead of avoiding the glitchy moments, I can work with them and make that part of the aesthetic. I left the chat feeling more confident that the chaos in my project isn‚Äôt a mistake it‚Äôs actually one of the most compelling parts

## HomeWork

### Sianne Ngai: Zany, Cute, Interesting

#### "Unlike the interesting, the zany really works against its constraints."

#### What do you think she means by this?

I think Wark means that ‚Äúzany‚Äù isn‚Äôt just crazy or silly for no reason. It‚Äôs about trying really hard to keep up like someone doing too much at once, under pressure. The ‚Äúzany‚Äù feeling comes from fighting against limits, not ignoring them.

#### In what ways would you consider the chaotic and the zany to be similar? In what ways are they different?

They‚Äôre both messy and unpredictable. But chaotic feels more random like things falling apart on their own. Zany feels more like someone is trying too hard, and that makes it feel funny or awkward. Chaos is just wild, but zaniness has personality like someone juggling too many things at once and almost dropping them.

#### In what ways would you consider your AT2 to be zany?

My project is zany because it starts out okay, but then it starts to break a little the roots grow too fast, the visuals and sound go a bit weird. It feels like the system is trying to stay together but can‚Äôt, and that makes it kind of funny or interesting. Mux said he liked when it broke, and I realized that‚Äôs part of what makes it work.

#### What might be some ways to make your AT2 more zany?

I could make it react more strongly when the user clicks or moves their mouse like the system is freaking out. I could also add funny or strange sounds, or make the visuals shake or stretch. Basically, make it feel like the project is trying really hard, but getting overwhelmed in a fun way.

### Accompaniment to your AT2

| Concept           | Example from My Code                                                          | What It Does                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variables**     | `let roots = []`, `let count = 0`, `let rate = ...`                           | Stores changing values like the root network, sound speed, or interaction states. |
| **Iteration**     | `for (let r of roots) { r.grow(); }`                                          | Loops through all root objects every frame to make them grow.                     |
| **Functions**     | `setup()`, `draw()`, `mousePressed()`, `playVibraphone(rate)`                 | Breaks tasks into smaller parts like drawing, interaction, and playing sound.     |
| **Boolean Logic** | `if (audioContext.state === 'suspended') {...}` <br> `if (random(1) < 0.005)` | Controls flow and checks conditions for sound and recursive root growth.          |
| **Arrays**        | `let roots = []` <br> `const notes = [62, 66, 69, ...]`                       | Stores multiple objects like growing roots and MIDI note sequences.               |
| **Classes**       | `class Root { constructor() {...} grow() {...} }`                             | Organizes how each root grows and behaves in 3D space.                            |
| **Recursion**     | `if (random(1) < 0.005) roots.push(new Root(...));`                           |

### How it responds to the chosen text

My AT2 project was really shaped by What Is It Like to Be a Fungus? especially the parts about how fungi survive chaos and make their own kind of world. I liked the idea that fungi aren‚Äôt neat or controlled, but still manage to grow and adapt in unpredictable ways. That‚Äôs what I tried to show in my piece: the visuals keep branching and multiplying until they start to feel unstable, like the system is a bit overwhelmed, but still going. The way it breaks a little is actually part of the point it mirrors how fungi push through messy environments and keep building networks. Even the sound shifts and reacts as things grow. I wanted the whole thing to feel alive and weird, like it‚Äôs constantly on the move and never really finished, just like the fungi in the text.

### Why you consider it to be post-digital

My project feels post-digital because it‚Äôs not trying to be clean or perfect it‚Äôs abstract, messy, and kind of unpredictable on purpose. It leans into the fact that it‚Äôs made with code, but it also plays with how things can go a bit wrong or glitchy. The system grows and reacts in ways I can‚Äôt fully control, and I actually like that. It responds to the user, loops through chaos, and sometimes feels like it‚Äôs about to fall apart but that‚Äôs part of what makes it feel alive. To me, post-digital art is about mixing digital tools with human unpredictability, and that‚Äôs exactly what this piece does.
