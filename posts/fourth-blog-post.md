# This is Week 3 Session 1

## Reflection

In this class, Mux Thomas explained functions and classes in a way that actually made sense to me.

He said a function is kind of like a set of instructions—like writing a recipe.

Defining the function is just writing the recipe down.
Calling the function is actually doing the thing—like cooking the food.
In p5, some functions just get called on their own (like draw() and setup()), which is cool.
He also mentioned something called side effects, which is when a function changes something outside of itself. He said they’re quick and easy, but can also make things messy if you’re not careful.
We also talked about inputs and outputs in functions:

The inputs are called arguments
The outputs are what the function returns
Then we moved onto classes, and Mux explained them like cookie cutters 🍪.

The class is the cutter itself—the shape.
The constructor() is what fills it with the dough (your object data).
Then you can make a bunch of objects that all use the same shape but have different ingredients (like different colours, positions, speeds, etc.)
We also talked a bit about using images and sound:

A dot (.) means we’re using a method (something the object can do)
A field is the info the object holds (like its colour or size)
push() is a method that puts things into an array
loadSound() is how we get a sound file into our sketch so we can use it
Overall, this session helped a lot. I don’t fully get everything yet, but Mux’s explanations made it feel less scary. It feels like I’m starting to understand how to build more interesting stuff by combining functions and classes.

In this piece, the screen is filled with a solid blue background and several flat 2D clouds moving at a fairly fast speed across the screen. The clouds aren’t fluffy or soft — they’re simple vector shapes with bold black outlines, kind of like cartoon drawings. The interaction is really minimal but fun: when your mouse hovers over a cloud, it disappears with a small popping sound.

Visuals
The clouds are outlined, flat shapes — not detailed or gradient, just clean and 2D.
The blue background is simple and solid — no texture, just a smooth, sky-like tone.
The fast movement of the clouds adds energy — it doesn’t feel super calm like fluffy clouds, but more like a slightly playful, arcade-y vibe.
The design is still charming because it’s so minimal — cute in a graphic, intentional way, almost like a sticker or a zine illustration.

Sound
When you hover over a cloud, it makes a short, light “pop” sound.
It’s not over-the-top or loud — just a quick burst that’s satisfying.
The sound gives feedback without being annoying. It’s almost like the cloud wants to pop when you hover over it.
There’s no background music — just silence and the occasional “pop.”

Interaction
No clicking needed — just hovering makes the cloud disappear.
The clouds don’t reappear, so it kind of feels like you’re clearing the sky.
The interaction is playful, but also a bit weirdly meditative — you can slowly wipe the screen clean of clouds if you feel like it.
It’s super easy and low-stress. There’s no goal, no game over, no score.
Even though it’s not “kawaii” cute, this piece is cute in a graphic, quirky, and satisfying way:

The visuals are bold and flat, but not aggressive.
The interaction is simple, immediate, and responsive.
The sound is playful and light, adding fun without chaos.
It feels like a digital toy — something you could zone out with, or mess with just because it’s oddly satisfying.
