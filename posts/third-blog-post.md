## HomeWork

During our discussion in class we discussed what cute visuals will look like and with my talk with Joolie we said cute visuals are rounded in shape, Pastel and bright colours, have a messy feature but in a understandable way, and something that has bigger features. For me to make something in the cute aesthetic visual i would stick to a more inviting colour palette and have softer glow features on its outer areas.

For cute sounds I feel like shorter squeaks like light that doesnt involve shock softness cute animals short soft stuff that are vaguely musical, melody over noise. noise isnt nesecarily cute you need to add a tone to it

For Cute interactions a quick short interaction that gives a ripple of glows give me a thougth of cute interaction
