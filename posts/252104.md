# Week 10 Session 1

## HomeWork

I’ve been thinking about how I might incorporate WebRTC into my AT3 project, which is currently about building a dreamlike, floating Bhutanese monastery made of light and points a kind of emotional, 3D memory of a sacred space. Originally, this was going to be a solo experience, but the more I worked on it, the more I realized that this space could also be shared and maybe it should be.

Using WebRTC, I could allow multiple users to enter the experience at once and affect the environment together in small ways maybe each person controls a light or a "pulse" in the air. Their presence could ripple the temple, subtly bending or glowing parts of the structure in response to their movement or click. It wouldn’t be a loud, chat-based collaboration. It would be quiet and ambient the way wind and touch change the feeling of a room.

If I were to actually build this, I’d need to learn more about how peer-to-peer connections work using WebRTC especially the data channel, which lets browsers send info like cursor position or user input. I’d also need to figure out how to sync visuals across different clients in real time without breaking the mood or crashing everything (which I admit I’m still scared of).

On top of that, I’d probably need to:

Set up some basic signaling so people can connect

Learn how to handle latency and disconnections

Maybe design a minimal onboarding interface so people don’t get confused when they enter

What I love about this idea is that it aligns with the concept of mycelial creativity where creativity doesn’t just come from one person, but from a network of participants, each influencing the other quietly, organically. In this case, people aren’t just watching the temple they’re part of it. They shape it by being there. Just like a mycelial network responds to the environment, the digital temple could respond to the presence of others glowing, shifting, adapting in real time.

The end result wouldn’t be a conversation, or a loud multiplayer game — it would be more like a shared presence. A feeling that we’re all part of something living and connected.

Each user sends small interactions (mouse position, clicks, pressure, sound) and those get blended into the same 3D space.

This would take a lot of learning, but I think the payoff would be beautiful. It wouldn’t just be my project it would grow with other people, like a little fungus in a forest of glowing light.

# Week 10 Session 2

Scripting in Unity

I chose to explore scripting in Unity for this task. It felt like the most natural choice because Unity was actually one of the first creative tools I learned in my first semester. I remember being introduced to it in a basic way. We worked with simple objects, played around with the scene view. At the time, I didn’t fully understand everything, but it made an impression. So for this task, it felt right to return to Unity and go a little deeper. It felt more meaningful to keep building on something familiar rather than jump into a completely new system.

I followed some beginner-friendly Unity tutorials to refresh what I learned and pick up some new things. I learned more about how Unity uses C# scripts to control movement, behavior, and interactions in 3D space. After getting comfortable again, I created a small script where a cube floats up and down using a sine wave. It was a simple effect, but it looked smooth and alive. The floating motion felt soft, almost like the cube was breathing. It was nice to watch it move like that and know that I made it work through code.

Here is the script I wrote:

```csharp
void Update()
{
    float floatSpeed = 2f;
    float floatHeight = 0.5f;
    float y = Mathf.Sin(Time.time * floatSpeed) * floatHeight;
    transform.position = new Vector3(transform.position.x, y, transform.position.z);
}
```

I like Unity because it helps me see what my code is doing in real time. I can test things instantly and understand what each line affects. That live feedback helps me learn better because I’m not just reading errors or guessing what’s happening. I can actually see it. I also like how Unity mixes visuals with code. It’s not just writing scripts. It’s about building something with both logic and design at the same time.

Compared to other scripting languages, Unity’s workflow feels more structured. It expects certain things to be written in certain ways, and that can be a little strict at first. But once I understood the pattern, I liked how organized it felt. It gives me access to powerful tools like physics, lighting, and camera control without needing to write everything from scratch. It’s more than just a coding language. It’s a full environment for building interactive ideas.

When I think about scripting languages in general versus compiled languages, I think scripting is better for creativity and prototyping. Scripting lets you write something quickly and see it working without needing to wait for long compile times. It’s great for trial and error, which is how I work most of the time. Compiled languages can be more efficient and powerful in certain ways, but they can also slow down the creative process. Scripting languages give more space for experimentation, which I find important in creative projects.

I’m glad I chose Unity for this task. It felt like a small return to something I had left introduced. Now I understand it more, and I feel more confident in using it for future work. I think Unity could be a part of my creative practice moving forward. I’d love to explore how to use it for small interactive pieces, playful environments, or visual experiments. And I know I still have a lot to learn, but it’s exciting to keep going with something that already feels like home.
