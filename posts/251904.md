### 5 communities of practice

| Community                | Domain                               | Repertoire                                       | Values                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 🏀 Basketball Community  | Playing basketball + post-game hangs | Trying new plays, team talk, spontaneous games   | Teamwork, hype, friendly competition |
| 🇧🇹 Bhutanese Community   | Culture, language, and tradition     | Sharing folklore, traditional dress, events      | Heritage, connection, pride          |
| 🍳 Online Cooking CoP    | Supporting home cooks worldwide      | Sharing recipes, hacks, tips across regions      | Creativity, sharing, accessibility   |
| 🎉 Friendsssssssss       | Yapping, partying, vibing            | Talking about movies, music, planning nights out | Loyalty, laughter, chaos             |
| 📚 Old People Community  | Intergenerational story exchange     | Telling legends, sharing advice, spilling tea    | Respect, wisdom, slow vibes          |
| 💻 Creative Coding Class | Learning code for art and expression | Generative visuals, errors, breakthroughs        | Exploration, experimentation, pain   |

In our creative coding class, we’re learning how to use code to make art. That’s our domain — not just programming, but making weird, expressive, interactive stuff. Our repertoire includes tools like p5.js, Three.js, broken sketches, happy accidents, and lots of console errors. We share what we make, help each other debug, and sometimes just sit in silence figuring it out together. What we value most is curiosity, experimentation, and not being afraid to mess things up. It’s a space where it’s okay to try something strange and see what happens.

### Brainstroming Ideas

For AT3, I want to focus on the Bhutanese community, which is something I always come back to in my work. It feels natural it’s a community I’m part of, and a lot of what I make reflects my culture, whether I plan for it or not. That’s why for this project, I want to create a 3D drone show in Three.js that forms a Bhutanese monastery in the sky.

I like the idea of using points of light instead of solid forms, because it’s kind of surreal like a dream version of something real. It’s also visually chaotic in a beautiful way, like drones trying to hold shape, shifting and realigning. I think that connects to Ngai’s idea of the zany this structure is trying to stay together, but maybe it's working a little too hard. That pressure is what makes it interesting. It’s not perfect or graceful it’s a bit awkward, full of effort, which makes it zany instead of just interesting.

Compared to AT2 (where roots grew out of control), this project would be more about collective movement drones as a community of glowing dots working together to form something spiritual. In that way, the drones are kind of like people: everyone moving in sync, trying to build something meaningful — but things still wiggle, drift, and maybe glitch a little. That’s where the fun and personality comes in.

It’s also meaningful because it's something the Bhutanese community could emotionally connect with — seeing a familiar structure represented in a futuristic, playful way. It turns cultural memory into an interactive, moving sculpture. And as a member of both the Bhutanese community and the creative coding classroom, I think it bridges the mycelial creativity idea too — one node connecting tradition, tech, culture, and experimentation.

For this part of the project, I worked with Sam and Lam to try some live coding together. At first, I was honestly scared the idea of writing code live, in front of other people, felt really intimidating. It’s one thing to mess around on your own screen, but it’s another to do it with people watching or reacting in real time. But once we got into it, I realized how fun it actually was. We weren’t trying to be perfect we were just playing around, trying things, reacting to each other’s changes, and laughing at the weird stuff we made. It made coding feel way more like jamming with friends than like schoolwork.

### Live Coding as a Community of Practice

Domain: Live coding is about making creative stuff like music, visuals, or performances by writing code live, as it runs. It’s where coding meets art, and it’s less about getting things perfect and more about exploring what code can do in the moment. It’s a mix of creativity and tech, and that’s what brings the community together.

Repertoire: This community uses tools like TidalCycles, Hydra, SuperCollider, FoxDot, and sometimes even p5.js. It values improvisation, real-time collaboration, glitch, error, rhythm, and play. ( copied this from online)

Values: This community values openness, play, and showing your work while it’s still in progress. It’s not about being polished it’s about being real. Bugs and weird errors aren’t problems; they’re part of the performance. There’s a strong DIY energy, and people are supportive and open to sharing what they’re doing, even when it’s messy.

### Live Coding, Culture, and Education

Live coding feels really connected to cultural performance like music, theatre, and other live art forms. It’s creative, collaborative, and you’re watching things happen in real time, which makes it exciting. I think that’s why it works so well for young people. It taps into the kind of learning that’s playful and expressive, not just about getting the “right” answer. When you’re live coding, you get to see what you’re making as you go, and that kind of immediate feedback is super motivating.

In terms of education, live coding challenges the usual way we teach coding — where everything has to be clean and correct. Instead, it shows that learning can be messy, fun, and based on trying things out. It could really change the way we think about teaching tech and art together.

On a bigger level, live coding also opens up conversations about who gets to code and what coding is even for. It’s not just about jobs or productivity it’s also about expression and creativity. That’s important when we think about public debate or policy. If more people saw coding as something artistic and accessible, maybe education systems and even funding laws would start to support it more.


## 🪷 1. Preserving and sharing cultural identity
Your work helps keep Bhutanese traditions, symbols, and values alive — especially for younger generations or those living abroad who might feel disconnected from their roots.

## 🧵 2. Inviting others into your world
By expressing my cultural story through colour and design, i'm opening a door for others (inside and outside your culture) to learn, connect, and feel something personal.

## 🤲 3. Starting conversations
Whether it’s through visuals, installations, or digital media, your pieces spark dialogue about belonging, femininity, heritage, and creativity  topics that resonate across communities.
