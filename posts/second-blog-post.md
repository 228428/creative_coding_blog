# This is Week 1, Session 1

## Reflection

This was my first class of second year, and to be honest, I was quite skeptical about creative coding. Coding has never been my strongest skill, and it wasn’t something I felt particularly confident about. Nonetheless, as the saying goes, "What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger."

The first class was mostly an introduction, and at the beginning, I felt a little lost. However, as the lesson progressed, I slowly started catching on. When the concept of frameCount was introduced, something clicked for me. It might be an exaggeration to say that I felt like I could do anything, but it did spark an interest in a subject I had been dreading. I can now see why Capogreco is so passionate about it—it’s a mind-boggling subject with so much to explore. My only hope is that I do well and don’t let anyone down.

In this class, we covered the absolute basics, but what stood out to me as new and intriguing were frameCount and the modular % operator. Honestly, at the start, when Mux Thomas asked us to create a square within a square, I felt a bit dumb. But despite that initial struggle, I have a lot of hope for this subject. I’m looking forward to seeing how much I can learn and improve as the semester goes on.
