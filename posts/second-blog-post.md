# This is Week 1, Session 1

## Reflection

This was my first class of second year, and to be honest, I was quite skeptical about creative coding. Coding has never been my strongest skill, and it wasn’t something I felt particularly confident about. Nonetheless, as the saying goes, "What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger."

The first class was mostly an introduction, and at the beginning, I felt a little lost. However, as the lesson progressed, I slowly started catching on. When the concept of frameCount was introduced, something clicked for me. It might be an exaggeration to say that I felt like I could do anything, but it did spark an interest in a subject I had been dreading. I can now see why Capogreco is so passionate about it—it’s a mind-boggling subject with so much to explore. My only hope is that I do well and don’t let anyone down.

In this class, we covered the absolute basics, but what stood out to me as new and intriguing were frameCount and the modular % operator. Honestly, at the start, when Mux Thomas asked us to create a square within a square, I felt a bit dumb. But despite that initial struggle, I have a lot of hope for this subject. I’m looking forward to seeing how much I can learn and improve as the semester goes on.

## HomeWork 1

### The code I used to fix the problem is

![Grids](homework1.png)
to be very honest in the beginng i wasn't vey sure what technique would be used to create a loop with this but using the p5.js referernce and a youtube video allowed to come to the conclusion of a nested for loop.

## HomeWork 2

![Horizon](horizon.png)
We were asked to choose a work by Rafaël Rozendaal and I chose his work called the horizon. To describe the artwork it is a canvas divided into two uneven sections in which both changes into randomised colour when the mouse is clicked on the screen. How I think the code works is that he would have set a canvas and create a shape on the lower section of the canvas.

# This is Week 1 Session 2

## Reflection

This session we got a deeper introduction into what creative coding is.

## Homework 1

During this task I spoke to my classmates Sam and Lam and this what what each of them had to say:

Sam

What do you think is going on, under the hood? In Sams perspective she noticed Every time you click the screen the colors change randomly so she came to the same conclusion as me and said we used the mouse press down.

what concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5? These are the skills she thinks would require me to learn this technique: Use RBG colors to randomize the color, mouse down code, creating a square on my canvas.

what resources might help me to learn those concepts? And these are the references she thinks would help me better understand the concept YouTube, p5 reference, and google.

Lam

Similarly

What do you think is going on, under the hood? Lam observed two squares when you click the screen the colors changes randomly.

what concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5? Lam said I would be required to learn how to change the color randomly when screen is clicked

what resources might help me to learn those concepts? simiar to sam, Lam gave me the same resources such as YouTube, p5 reference, and google

## Homework 2

For the second homework for htis session we were supposed to take one technique from the art work and apply it to p5.js an seeming that I had only one technique required I created somethging similar but with a circle to play on more shapes. This is the code:
