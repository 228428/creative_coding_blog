# Week 6 Session 1

## Reflection

This week’s session focused on signals and envelopes, and how they’re used in creative coding. We learned that envelopes can work with both milliseconds and seconds, but using seconds feels more intuitive — it’s easier to think in seconds than in tiny units like milliseconds. That small shift made a big difference in how I understood timing and movement in projects.

We also looked into phase, which moves between 0 and 1. But to use that in a creative way, you usually need to map it — basically transforming that 0 to 1 range into something else that suits your project. Whether it’s controlling position, speed, or even visual effects, mapping lets you reshape simple values into more complex behaviors. It’s like making your own rules for how something behaves.

Another thing we explored was using power curves like p\*\*3. This creates more dramatic, curved motion. For example, the higher you raise the power, the sharper or more sudden the movement or effect becomes. I started to understand how you could shape time-based behavior visually, like easing animations in and out in a stylized way.

One moment that really stood out to me was when Thomas showed us his glitchy teapot. I thought it was amazing — the way it broke apart, but still had structure. It honestly looked like digital sculpture. I had been struggling with trying to glitch my own teapot, so seeing his version helped me understand how far you could push things and how important randomness, noise, and distortion can be in generative art. It was a huge “aha” moment.

We also spent some time reading through code together as a class. At first, it felt overwhelming, but then — kind of oddly — I started to understand it. Like, lines of code that would’ve looked like gibberish to me before suddenly made sense. I’m still not perfect at it, but it felt like a real shift. Slowly but surely, it’s starting to click.

## HomeWork

From my research, I learnt:

### q5.js

#### What it’s for:

q5.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for creative coding, similar to p5.js but more minimal.

It’s made for fast and playful sketching using the HTML5 canvas, perfect for drawing, animation, and simple interaction.

#### Best for:

Quick visual experiments

Generative art

Interactive sketches

### c2.js

#### What it’s for:

c2.js is focused on generative art and geometric design, especially using recursion and 2D logic.

It gives you tools to create visuals through math-based systems and patterns.

#### Best for:

Algorithmic visuals (e.g. spirals, symmetry, fractals)

Geometry-driven art

Clean, rule-based design work

### svg.js

#### What it’s for:

svg.js is for working with SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) in the browser.

It lets you create, manipulate, and animate vector shapes easily using JavaScript.

#### Best for:

Vector graphics like icons or logos

Animations in web interfaces

Clean visuals that scale without losing quality

| Library    | Output Type      | Focus Area                          | Use Case Example                            |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **q5.js**  | HTML5 Canvas     | Creative coding & animation         | Drawing shapes, interactive sketches        |
| **c2.js**  | HTML5 Canvas     | Generative systems, geometric rules | Recursive patterns, algorithmic visuals     |
| **svg.js** | SVG (vector DOM) | Scalable graphics & animations      | Animating icons, building web illustrations |

### Can we use these libraries from within a javascript module? Explain why / why not.

According to my research, yes, we can use these libraries inside a JavaScript module, but it depends on how the library was written. Some libraries, like svg.js, are already available as ES modules, so we can import them directly using import statements, which works well in a modern JavaScript setup.

However, others like q5.js or c2.js might not be set up as modules by default. In those cases, we’d need to include them using a `<script>` tag in the HTML, or try to find a module-compatible version. It’s not always super smooth.

So overall, it’s possible, but not always simple—especially if the library wasn’t designed for modules in the first place.

### In what situations might a tool like esm.sh be useful?

According to my research, esm.sh is helpful when you're working with JavaScript modules and want to use libraries that weren’t originally written as ES modules. Sometimes, older libraries use different formats (like CommonJS), which don’t work well with the modern import system unless you use a build tool like Webpack or Vite. But with esm.sh, it converts those libraries into ES modules automatically, so you can import them directly using a URL—no need to install anything or set up complex tools. I think it’s especially useful if you’re just working on a small project, testing something quickly, or coding directly in the browser using `<script type="module">`.

### Use one of these libraries on your blog to demonstrate how to use a signal or envelope to make something change over time.

<!-- <canvas id="signal"></canvas>

<script type="module">
  // Import q5.js from esm.sh CDN
  import * as q5 from "https://esm.sh/q5"

  // Create a new q5 sketch
  new q5((sketch) => {
    let t = 0 // A time variable used to create a smooth oscillation

    // Setup function runs once when the sketch starts
    sketch.setup = () => {
      sketch.createCanvas(600, 400) // Create a canvas that is 600px wide and 400px tall
    }

    // Draw function runs continuously (like a loop)
    sketch.draw = () => {
      sketch.background(220) // Set background color to light grey

      let p = (sketch.sin(t) + 1) / 2 // Generate a smooth signal between 0 and 1

      let radius = sketch.map(p, 0, 1, 50, 150) // Map that signal to a circle radius between 50 and 150

      sketch.fill(255, 100, 150) // Set the fill color of the circle
      sketch.noStroke() // Remove the outline
      sketch.circle(sketch.width / 2, sketch.height / 2, radius) // Draw the circle in the center

      t += 0.05; // Increment time to animate
    }
  })
</script> -->

### Summary for Information and thinking

In Information and Thinking, Michel Serres explains that everything in the world — whether it's a living creature like a whale or something non-living like a crystal — emits, receives, stores, and processes information. These four actions are not unique to humans or machines; they are a universal pattern shared by all things. This challenges the idea that thinking is something only humans do. Instead, Serres suggests that “thinking” is just another way of describing how information moves through the world. Real information, according to him, isn’t the endless noise we get from the media — it’s something rare, meaningful, and valuable. He also emphasizes that networks of communication have existed for a long time, from ancient roads to the internet today. Everything, even rocks and rivers, carry traces of memory and knowledge. Serres ultimately argues that the world and everything in it, including us, are made of both matter and information — hard and soft — and that we are deeply connected to the world through this shared way of processing information.

### Summary for Xenofeminism

Xenofeminism is a manifesto that calls for using technology, science, and reason to fight against gender inequality and social injustice. The authors believe that instead of rejecting technology, feminism should embrace and reshape it to create a more equal world. They argue that gender, race, and class are not natural or fixed, but social systems that can be changed. Xenofeminism pushes for a world where traits like gender no longer determine power or opportunity. It also stresses the importance of thinking big — not just fighting for local change, but aiming for global systems that work for everyone. They believe in hacking and repurposing everything from digital tools to biology to build a freer, fairer future. Most importantly, they say we must not accept things as they are just because they seem “natural” — if nature is unjust, we should change it.

### Summary for What is it like to be a fungus?

What Is It Like to Be a Fungus by Merlin Sheldrake explores the fascinating world of fungi, which are everywhere but often go unnoticed. Fungi play essential roles in ecosystems, such as breaking down rocks, making soil, decomposing pollutants, and forming relationships with plants. They help plants providing nutrients through mycorrhizal networks, which connect trees in the "wood wide web." The author explains how fungi have been crucial in the evolution of life on Earth, from the ancient relationship between fungi and plants to their current role in creating new ecosystems.
Sheldrake also discusses how fungi adapt to extreme environments and their metabolic abilities, such as breaking down tough materials like lignin and even radioactive waste. He reflects on how fungi influence humans, from providing food and medicine (like penicillin) to offering solutions for environmental problems like oil spills. The author shares his personal fascination with fungi and their complex behaviors, particularly their ability to form networks and interact with other organisms in surprising ways. Ultimately, the text highlights the mysterious, powerful role fungi play in life on Earth and how they continue to shape the world around us.

# Week 6 Session 2

## Reflection

In this session, we looked into the difference between CPU and GPU processing. I learned that while CPUs are great for handling general tasks one at a time, GPUs are designed for parallel tasks, which makes them especially useful for visual work like graphics and rendering.

We also learned about shaders, which are small programs that run on the GPU to control how each pixel is drawn. These are written in a language called GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language). One thing that stood out to me was how numbers need to be written properly to work for example, 1 is an integer, but 1.0 is a float. This reminded me how precise you have to be when writing code for visuals.

Another key topic was the idea of taxonomy and symbolic response. This is about how we use symbols and structure to encode a message in a way that others can clearly decode. It made me think about how meaning is built not just through visuals, but through intentional structure and interpretation.

This session helped me understand how technical tools like shaders connect directly to creative decisions and how combining both can lead to more expressive digital artworks.

#### choose which text you would like to respond to for your AT2.

##### pick three passages from the text that speak to you the loudest

1 "Fungi are veteran survivors of ecological disruption."

This quote really stuck with me. It made me think about how fungi don’t just survive chaos they grow through it. That felt powerful, especially in today’s world where disruption feels constant. I started to see glitch and randomness not as flaws, but as part of the process like the fungi, my work doesn’t need to be clean or perfect to have meaning. In my piece, the visuals evolve even when things get messy. Lines multiply, shapes distort, and yet somehow, it all keeps growing. It’s about embracing instability as a kind of resilience turning breakdown into a creative force.

2 "Some fungi have tens of thousands of mating types."

I love how weird and wonderful this fact is. It completely breaks the idea that identity or connection has to be binary. It made me think about how creativity, like fungi, can exist in endless forms. I wanted to reflect that in my work by letting things shift and change constantly. No two interactions are the same, just like no two fungi might connect in the same way. It’s about complexity, unpredictability, and the beauty of not fitting into a single box. That felt really freeing, especially in a digital space where we’re often expected to follow structure.

3 "Fungi make worlds."

There’s something poetic about this line. It made me see fungi not just as organisms, but as architects quiet builders shaping everything around them. That really influenced how I approached this project. I wanted my piece to feel like it was making its own little world slowly, through interaction. Every movement, every glitch, every ripple adds something. It’s not about control it’s about setting up a system that reacts and grows. Just like fungi, the artwork spreads and shifts, forming something more complex than I could’ve planned on my own.

#### Pick two techniques we have covered over the course of this unit

##### 1 Recursion

I used recursion in your root growth system:

Each Root object can spawn more Root objects over time.

This recursive branching mimics natural fungal networks and creates visual complexity.

It also reflects the idea of “fungi making worlds” and surviving through chaotic growth.

##### 2 Glitch

My piece leans into visual and sonic glitch aesthetics:

The growing lines and angles shift unpredictably, producing a kind of beautiful chaos.

You embraced randomness and distortion in both the visuals and the reactive audio (oscillator frequency changes over time).

This glitchy behavior mirrors the quote “fungi are veteran survivors of ecological disruption” — growing not in spite of disorder, but through it.

##### Bonus: Also used

3D (p5.js with WEBGL): I used a 3D canvas and positioned the camera to view a space where roots grow in all directions.

Sonic Signals: I added an oscillator that responds to interaction and growth — modulating frequency and amplitude, which touches on sound signals and dynamic envelopes.

#### AT2 Rough Draft – "Mycelial Memory Glitch"

For this project, I was really inspired by the way fungi are described in the essay especially the line that said they’re “veteran survivors of ecological disruption.” That idea stuck with me. Fungi don’t just survive chaos they grow through it. I wanted to explore that by building something that felt alive and unpredictable, something that keeps evolving even when things get messy. That’s why I leaned heavily into recursion. In my piece, the “roots” grow and split, and sometimes randomly spawn more roots. It’s a digital system that keeps multiplying, like a mycelial network, creating complexity just by existing.

I also embraced glitch as part of the process not something to fix, but something to work with. The growth in my artwork doesn’t happen smoothly or perfectly. Lines wobble, branches go in odd directions, and the screen can start to look chaotic over time. But that chaos is the point. It’s about letting go of control and seeing what the system creates on its own. I also found the line about fungi having “tens of thousands of mating types” really beautiful it reminded me that nature doesn’t follow binary rules. So I designed my system to reflect that kind of fluidity. There’s no one way it’s supposed to look, and it never turns out the same way twice.

The last quote “fungi make worlds” — helped me think about this project less like an artwork and more like a small digital ecosystem. The user doesn’t necessarily “play” it like a game, but they’re part of it. Their presence, their mouse movement, their clicks — all of that influences how it grows. The system listens and responds. In the end, this was my way of making a tiny, post-digital world a weird, glitchy, evolving space that doesn’t follow a script but somehow still makes sense.

#### Feedback Reflection

🗣 Sam
Sam described the work as “cute,” which at first felt a bit off from my intention. It made me pause and think about how the visual softness or color choices might be sending a different tone than the chaotic, world-building nature I was trying to channel. Her reaction actually helped me decide to lean more into sketchiness and distortion to intentionally push the piece away from being too polished or playful, and instead toward something raw, layered, and unsettled. It reminded me that aesthetic mood communicates as much as the code itself.

Mux Thomas
Mux appreciated how the system “broke” not in a failure sense, but in how it visually tipped into overload and unexpected behavior. He encouraged me to embrace that and not clean it up too much. That really aligned with what I was aiming for in terms of chaos and effective complexity: letting recursion and randomness run wild, but still having a system that self-sustains. His comment made me think of fungi not as neatly designed forms but messy survivors that leave behind trails, fragments, and sudden shifts. I started thinking more about letting my interface feel like it's decaying or rebuilding mid-render not just growing.

Based on the feedback I got, I’ve decided to lean further into the things that are already working in my piece. Mux mentioned how he liked the way the system started to “break” visually as it grew, and that made me realize I should stop trying to clean it up the chaos is part of the charm. I want to let the glitch build up more and make that messy, unpredictable growth feel even more alive. Sam called the piece “cute,” which made me second guess the tone a bit I think I can push the visuals to feel a bit sketchier or more raw, maybe by adjusting the colors or letting lines stack in a less tidy way. they mentioned they liked how the user isn’t in full control, but more like a participant in the system, which reassured me that the quiet interaction style actually makes sense with the themes I’m working with. So for the next stage, I’m focusing on keeping that feeling of something slowly, weirdly evolving — a digital world that doesn’t follow a script but still grows in its own way.
