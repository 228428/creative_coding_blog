# This is Week 1, Session 1

## Reflection

This was my first class of second year, and to be honest, I was quite skeptical about creative coding. Coding has never been my strongest skill, and it wasn’t something I felt particularly confident about. Nonetheless, as the saying goes, "What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger."

The first class was mostly an introduction, and at the beginning, I felt a little lost. However, as the lesson progressed, I slowly started catching on. When the concept of frameCount was introduced, something clicked for me. It might be an exaggeration to say that I felt like I could do anything, but it did spark an interest in a subject I had been dreading. I can now see why Capogreco is so passionate about it—it’s a mind-boggling subject with so much to explore. My only hope is that I do well and don’t let anyone down.

In this class, we covered the absolute basics, but what stood out to me as new and intriguing were frameCount and the modular % operator. Honestly, at the start, when Mux Thomas asked us to create a square within a square, I felt a bit dumb. But despite that initial struggle, I have a lot of hope for this subject. I’m looking forward to seeing how much I can learn and improve as the semester goes on.

## HomeWork 1

### The code I used to fix the problem is

to be very honest in the beginng i wasn't vey sure what technique would be used to create a loop with this but using the p5.js referernce and a youtube video allowed to come to the conclusion of a nested for loop.

## HomeWork 2

We were asked to choose a work by Rafaël Rozendaal and I chose his work called the horizon. To describe the artwork it is a canvas divided into two uneven sections in which both changes into randomised colour when the mouse is clicked on the screen. How I think the code works is that he would have set a canvas and create a shape on the lower section of the canvas.

## Reflection

In this session, we stepped away from coding and explored the history and ideas behind creative coding. I found it really eye-opening to learn how it started—not just as a technical skill, but as a form of artistic expression. It made me realise that coding can be more than logic; it can be playful, experimental, and even emotional.

Understanding the backstory helped ease some of my doubts. It reminded me that creative coding isn’t about perfection—it’s about curiosity and trying new things. I still have a lot to learn, but this session gave me a better sense of why we’re doing this, and that makes me feel a bit more confident moving forward.

## Homework 1

### Rafaël Rozendaal – Classmate Reflections

During this task, I spoke to my classmates Sam and Lam about the Rafaël Rozendaal work I chose last session. I asked them three questions to help deepen my understanding of how I could replicate a similar interaction using p5.js.

### Sam

#### What do you think is going on, under the hood?

Sam noticed that every time you click the screen, the colors change randomly. She agreed with my observation that this effect likely uses the mousePressed() function.

#### What concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5?

She mentioned that I’d need to learn how to:

Use RGB colors to randomize the background or object colors
Use the mousePressed() function
Create and position a square on the canvas

#### What resources might help me to learn those concepts?

Sam suggested:

YouTube tutorials
The p5.js reference page
Good old Google search

### Lam

#### What do you think is going on, under the hood?

Lam observed that there are two squares on the screen, and clicking causes their colors to change randomly.

#### What concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5?

He explained that I’d need to learn how to:

Detect mouse clicks
Randomize color using RGB values
Apply those colors to the shapes

#### What resources might help me to learn those concepts?

Like Sam, Lam recommended:

YouTube
p5.js reference
Google

## Homework 2

For the second homework of this session, we were asked to take one technique from the Rafaël Rozendaal artwork we discussed and apply it in p5.js. The main technique I focused on was the use of random color changes triggered by mouse clicks.

Since that was the only technique required, I decided to keep it simple and stay true to the original form—I kept the shape as a square. This helped me focus purely on understanding and applying the color-changing interaction without getting distracted by other elements.:
