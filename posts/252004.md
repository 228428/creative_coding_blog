# Week 9 Session 1

## HomeWork

For this part of AT3, I used three different language models to help me brainstorm ideas for my final project. The goal was to think through the communities I care about especially the Bhutanese community, my creative coding class, and this chaotic but playful way I code that my teacher lovingly calls vibe coding.

Each model helped me think about domain, repertoire, and values in different ways, and I also asked them for help figuring out what tech stacks or formats could work. Honestly, this whole thing was a bit experimental, but that feels fitting.

### Claude

Community: Bhutanese community
Domain: Cultural memory and traditional art
Repertoire: Oral stories, monastery architecture, rituals, and design motifs
Values: Respect, storytelling, connection to history and place

Claude helped me explore the idea of a drone temple built with light, made from a point cloud or particle system. It suggested that each light could symbolize a figure or a story. It also reminded me to think about the emotional side of the experience ‚Äî what it would feel like for someone from the community to see a piece like this.

Tech-wise, Claude suggested using a .glb model of a Bhutanese monastery in Three.js and transforming it into a point-based visual. It was also cautious about performance, which honestly was helpful.

Vibe: Respectful, detailed, emotionally aware ‚Äî like a design advisor who really wants you to think things through.

### Loveable

Community: Bhutanese community
Domain: Cultural expression in a modern, playful form
Repertoire: Bright colors, dancing visuals, glitchy experiments, folklore motifs
Values: Playfulness, reinterpretation, community expression, joyful chaos

Loveable came in with wild energy. It pitched a multiplayer temple show, where each person in the audience could control a ‚Äúdrone dot‚Äù and co-create the temple live in the browser ‚Äî like collaborative digital architecture. It imagined each drone ‚Äúdancing‚Äù to music or traditional sounds while forming shapes together, sometimes breaking, sometimes reforming.

Feasibility tips: It suggested socket.io for real-time group control, Three.js for rendering, and Supabase or Firebase for data syncing. It said not to worry if it breaks ‚Äúlean into the glitch!‚Äù

Vibe: Unfiltered enthusiasm. Gave total ‚Äúart kid who codes with glitter‚Äù energy.

### Gemini (Google)

Community: Bhutanese community
Domain: Emotionally-driven visual storytelling
Repertoire: Flowing geometry, sacred space energy, breath-like animations
Values: Atmosphere, reverence, memory, fluidity

Gemini took a slower, dreamier approach. It imagined a temple not as an object, but as a feeling. It suggested I build an ambient 3D space that feels like being inside a memory of a Bhutanese monastery ‚Äî with glowing waves, soft drones (sound, not flying ones), and visuals that pulse in time with user input. Instead of clear geometry, it would be made of shifting lights that loosely form and dissolve.

Feasibility tips: Tone.js for subtle ambient sound, Three.js for dynamic visual shifts, and just HTML + JS ‚Äî no backend. The emphasis was on stillness and motion coexisting.

Vibe: Gentle, emotional, almost meditative. It helped me reconnect to the why behind the project, not just the how.

### GIF

![Looping gif](/scripts/252004/myloop-ezgif.com-optimize.gif)

I followed a tutorial on how to make a simple looping gif in Processing. It was about using math to move a dot in a perfect circle which creates a smooth loop when you save the frames and play them back as a gif. The code was clean and easy to follow, and I got it working pretty quickly. But once I saw it, I felt like it was missing something. It did the job, but it didn‚Äôt really feel like me.

So I asked Claude, my AI assistant, how I could make it feel more like my own style. Claude suggested a few changes: darkening the background, adding some color, and using sine waves to animate the size and glow of the dot. Those suggestions made a lot of sense to me. I didn‚Äôt want the animation to feel technical I wanted it to feel soft, calm, and kind of alive.

I made the background a deep purple, then made the dot slowly pulse in size. I also added a gentle shift in color using sine and cosine just enough to make it shimmer a little as it loops. I kept the circle motion from the original code because it was already so clean, but these small changes made it feel more personal and dreamy. It became less of a tutorial outcome and more like a little loop that breathes.

Once I had all the frames saved, I used gifsicle in Terminal to combine them into a gif. That part got messy because I didn‚Äôt name my gif properly at first and couldn‚Äôt get it to show up in my blog. I asked for help, figured out the path was wrong, fixed it, and eventually got the gif to load. I embedded it into my blog post using the correct file path, and when I saw it looping on the page, I felt really proud.

The process wasn‚Äôt smooth all the way through. I had a couple crashouts just because I didn‚Äôt follow instructions properly or forgot where I put things. But I‚Äôm glad I stuck with it. I think that‚Äôs part of coding too not just writing code, but figuring things out as you go. In the end, the gif loops perfectly, and even though it‚Äôs small, it feels like something I made with care.

# Week 9 Session 2

## HomeWork

I first got curious about TouchDesigner after a graduate named Minnie came to class and showed us her final project. Her work was so layered and emotional. It blended real-time visuals with personal narrative in a way that felt really alive. Seeing her patch unfold on the screen, how it moved and responded, made something click in me. I kept thinking, ‚ÄúI want to do that. I want to make something that feels like that.‚Äù

So I decided to try TouchDesigner for this task. I‚Äôd heard it was powerful for creating interactive visuals and installations but honestly, it always seemed a bit intimidating. Once I found a beginner-friendly tutorial series on YouTube though, I realized it wasn‚Äôt as scary as I thought. It‚Äôs a visual programming language so instead of writing code line by line, you connect boxes (called operators) that each do something like taking webcam input, distorting the image, or adding feedback effects.

I followed along and built a patch using my webcam as the input. From there, I added different filters to distort the image in real time. Things like color warping, and glitch effects. Watching the image shift live as I moved around or dragged a slider felt so immediate. It was playful. I wasn‚Äôt overthinking the code. I was just reacting and experimenting. It reminded me a lot of the way Minnie talked about her process too. Not coding to solve something, but coding to express.

What I like about TouchDesigner is that it feels like a living space. It‚Äôs visual, reactive, and makes room for unpredictability. I think it could be a big part of my creative practice moving forward, especially if I want to work on installations, performative visuals, or interactive spaces. Things that respond to movement, sound, or presence. I‚Äôd also love to explore how it might connect with sound design or even my AT3 work where I‚Äôm already playing with dreamy, responsive environments.

Compared to other graphical programming tools, TouchDesigner is really well-suited for real-time media. But it‚Äôs not perfect. It can get overwhelming and it‚Äôs easy to get lost if your patch gets too messy. Still, I found that the more I used it, the more it made sense. The feedback loop of seeing something change as I build it really helped me understand how the system worked.

I think graphical programming languages like TouchDesigner are amazing for exploration. They don‚Äôt replace traditional code. Text-based coding is still better for complex logic or fine control. But GPLs let you create from feeling. You can improvise, follow your instincts, and that opens the door to a different kind of creativity. It reminds me of what we‚Äôve talked about in class. Mycelial creativity. Where the process grows from connections and reactions, not rigid plans.

Seeing Minnie‚Äôs work inspired me, but trying it myself made me believe I could do something like that too.
